    "# Monte Carlo Tree Search\n",
    "*Monte Carlo Tree Search* provides a way to evaluate **game state** without any **strategic knowledge** about the game. Instead of game-specific heuristics, the MCTS algorithm simulates *random games* to estimate how good a position is. One of these random games is a called: **rollout** \n",
    "\n",
    "*Monte Carlo Tree Search* is part of a larger family of *Monte Carlo Algorithms*, which use **Randomness** to analyze extremely complex situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The key idea** is that your **estimate** gets **more accurate** as you do **more rollouts** \n",
    "\n",
    "Each round of the MCTS algorithm takes three steps:\n",
    "1. Add a new board position to the MCTS tree\n",
    "2. Simulate a random game from that position\n",
    "3. Update the tree statistics with the results of that random game\n",
    "\n",
    "*You repeat this process as many times as you can in the time available. Then the statistics at the top of the tree tell you which move to pick* \n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you repeat the steps, the tree gets bigger, and the estimates at the top get more accurate. Normally, you stop after a fixed number of rounds or after a fixed amount of time passes. At that point you select the move that has the highest winning percentage."
