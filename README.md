# About This Repository
The purpose of this Repository is mainly for reference and educational purposes only. This will be a combination of both **Jupyter Notebooks** & **Python Scripts** describing the algorithms that go into **Deep Reinforcement Learning** & **Game Optimization**. 

Each **Notebook** Should have a set of examples, math description & more. 

## Installing
My suggestion would be to simply clone this repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/dmbernaal/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms.git
```
and run each notebook locally on your computer. The code has been made simple to understand and should have several of examples and comments!
