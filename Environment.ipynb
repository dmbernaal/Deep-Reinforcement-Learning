    "\n",
    "The ```step()``` method is the central piece in the environment's functioanlity, which does several things in one call: \n",
    "1. Telling the environment which action we'll execute on the next step\n",
    "2. Getting the new observation from the environment after this action\n",
    "3. Getting the reward the agent gained with this step\n",
    "4. Getting the indication that the episode is over\n",

    "* **observation**: A NumPy vector or a matrix with observation data\n",
    "* **reward**: This is the float value of the reward\n",
    "* **done**: This is a boolean indicator, which is ```True``` when the episode is over\n",
    "* **extra_info**: Anything environment-specific with extra information about the environment. \n",
